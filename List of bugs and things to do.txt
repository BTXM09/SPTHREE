1. HUD when opening a chest blocks the screen for too long (maybe unrender when player clicks?)
2. Sometimes door doesn't render (e.g. when transitioning from stage 3 to 4, doors in stage 4 don't appear)
3. Ranged enemies textures not working (turning, attacking, exclamation)
4. Ranged enemies don't die immediately if killed by shuriken/bullet (they finish their stun animation before dying)
5. Current point system only takes into account jewels (stealth kills, detection, etc. doesn't add or decrease points)
6. Minimap doesn't display correctly for some levels
7. Need to show the amount of Invisibiliy Scrolls player has in HUD
8. Add a readme.txt/instruction menu to explain our game
9. Add a pause menu (preferably with reset function)
10. Link menus to features such a highscore and save/load
11. Add day/night textures to our levels
12. Alpha the hero when he's invisible for better visual feedback
13. Item shop lacks information. Currently player only sees items on the ground. (atleast show how many jewels are needed to buy the item)
