5. Current point system only takes into account jewels (stealth kills, detection, etc. doesn't add or decrease points)
6. Minimap doesn't display correctly for some levels
7. Need to show the amount of Invisibiliy Scrolls player has in HUD
8. Add a readme.txt/instruction menu to explain our game
10. Link menus to features such a highscore and save/load
11. Add day/night textures to our levels
13. Item shop lacks information. Currently player only sees items on the ground. (atleast show how many jewels are needed to buy the item)
